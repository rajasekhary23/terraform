# Git pre-commit hooks

A Git pre-commit hook framework that runs:

Trivy secret scan

Linting

Terraform code scan

A bash setup script that:

Detects the OS (Linux/macOS/Windows via WSL)

Installs the prerequisites accordingly

We’ll make it so that you can just run ./setup.sh and then the hook works automatically.
```pgsql
.
├── .git
├── .git/hooks/pre-commit        # Generated by setup.sh
├── setup.sh                     # OS detection + installation
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml      # Optional if using pre-commit framework
```
### Run it
To setup the tool/packages required use ${\color{green}setup.sh \space}$ by providing +x executable permistions.
    

```sh
chmod +x setup.sh & bash setup.sh
```

Curently we are not using ${\color{red} just \space file}$ to setup environment.
